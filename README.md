# :book: Introduction

Welcome to the project repository for **Team 01 - The African Royals**. Here you will find all of the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.

We will create a small e-commerce website using Java, SpringBoot, and SQLite to sell one-of-a-kind African jewelry.

# :memo: Requirements

We gathered the functional and non-functional requirements for our jewelry store system.  
You can view all requirement artifacts below:

- [Requirements Overview](./requirements/README.md)
- [Use Case Diagram](./requirements/use-case-diagram.md)
- [Decision Table](./requirements/decision-table.md)
- [Requirements Presentation](./requirements/presentation.md)

<a id="user-interface-design"></a>
# :computer: User Interface Design

We designed a user interface that is not only simplistic and elegant, but incorporates our core functionalities while focusing on simplicity for the best user experience.
You can view the prototype of our design here:
- [User Inteface Design](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/agh5e5g)

You can also find the presentation of our UI design here:
- [UI Presentation](https://www.loom.com/share/0f586c76309f4b9b9a8f3f37fba346c8)

<a id="technical-design"></a>
# :apple: Technical Design

Having gathered our requirements and creating a user interface design, we created the technical design of our project which includes an ERD, entity/field descriptions,data storage plan, authentication and authorization plan and more. This sets out to give a more detailed and clear picture of the design of our project.

For detailed information on each aspect of these technical design elements click here:
- [Technical Design](./technical-design/README.md)

# Implementation
Having gone through the semester planning, gathering requirements and creating a technical design for our project, we concluded with the Implementation phase of the web application. We have created an implementation README that walks through how to clone our repository and set up the project locally on your machine.

You can view the Implementation Set Up here:

- Our implementation met our design on both frontend and backend. When we designed our prototype in Marvel, we had a certain vision that we wanted to come to life, and we made that happen through html and css. We learned that it is very valuable to give youreslf enough time to fix errors without rushing last minute. Upon implementing this project, we came to realize that the hardest part of this project was not each team member's individual code, but integrating everyone's code into a single branch and running the program successfully. This taught us how important it is to add documentation for your code. Although our implementation was a success, we need to practice time management as a team.
